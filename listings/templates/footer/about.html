        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Our History</h2>
        <p>
            MumiakGuides is the brainchild of a visionary fourth-year project led by Mitchel Mugono, a passionate and
            driven individual dedicated to making a positive impact. The project addresses a crucial need in the
            business landscape â€” the empowerment of small businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
            From its inception, MumiakGuides is evolving into a platform committed to showcasing the journey and
            achievements of small businesses. Mitchel's vision is to create a space where entrepreneurs can tell their
            stories, connect with a broader audience, and receive the recognition they deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of now, MumiakGuides is on the path to becoming a community-driven initiative, aiming to foster
            collaboration and provide valuable resources for small business owners. Our journey is anticipated to be
            marked by the success stories of those we will support, and we look forward to being inspired by the
            resilience and innovation of the small business community.
